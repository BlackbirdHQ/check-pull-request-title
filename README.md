# Check Pull Request Title

A GitHub action that checks that a PR title matches a regex patter.

Could be used for:

- Enforcing any commit convention.
- Enforcing including a Jira ticket rererence in the title.
- Enforcing using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

This is intended to be used with the [Autosquash](https://github.com/tibdex/autosquash) action so that squashed commit messages follow a convention.
